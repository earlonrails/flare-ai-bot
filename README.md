# Flare Arbitrage Bot (FAB)

## Overview

Welcome to Flare Arbitrage Bot (FAB)—a cutting-edge DeFi arbitrage bot built on the Flare Network. FAB harnesses real-time price data from Flare’s Time Series Oracle (FTSO) and Gemini’s AI-driven analysis to identify and exploit arbitrage opportunities across Kinetic, SparkDEX, and Sceptre. This model runs Confidential Space on gcloud network. Users deposit currency into our smart contract, receive FAB tokens tied to the bot’s performance, and can cash out by selling or burning tokens at the current price, which increases as the bot generates profits.

**Our mission:** Deliver secure, automated returns to users by capitalizing on Flare’s DeFi ecosystem.

## How It Works

### User Flow

1.  **Deposit Funds:**
    * Users send C2FLR (Coston2 testnet currency) to the FAB smart contract wallet.
    * In return, they receive FAB tokens proportional to their deposit (e.g., 1 C2FLR = 1 FAB initially).

2.  **Arbitrage Execution:**
    * The bot analyzes opportunities across:
        * **Kinetic:** Borrowing/staking for lending arbitrage.
        * **SparkDEX:** Liquidity pools and perpetual futures (SparkDEX Eternal).
        * **Sceptre:** Staking yield discrepancies (assumed staking platform on Flare).
    * **Strategy:** Borrow at low interest rates (e.g., Kinetic loans), stake where returns exceed borrowing costs, or exploit futures mispricings.

3.  **FTSO Integration:**
    * Uses FTSO price feeds (e.g., FLR/USD) for real-time asset valuation.

4.  **Gemini Bot Analysis:**
    * Our AI-powered “Gemini Bot” (simulated via rule-based logic for MVP) processes FTSO data to:
        * Estimate returns for each token/strategy (e.g., FLR staking vs. futures).
        * Recommend optimal arbitrage paths (e.g., “Borrow FLR at 2%, stake at 5%”).

5.  **Token Value Growth:**
    * As the bot generates profits, the FAB token price increases (e.g., via a bonding curve or profit reinvestment).
    * **Example:** Initial price $1, rises to $1.20 after 20% arbitrage gains.

6.  **Cash Out:**
    * Users sell or burn FAB tokens at the current price to withdraw profits in C2FLR.
